APOBEC_to_G_MutLoad_MinEstimate	"A minimum estimate of the number of APOBEC_to_G mutations induced by APOBEC cytidine deaminase in a sample.  This estimate is calculated using the formula: [""APOBEC_to_G""]*[(""tCw_to_G_enrich""-1)/""tCw_to_G_enrich""] to determine the number of APOBEC_to_G signature mutations in excess of what would be expected by random mutagenesis.  Calculated values are rounded to the nearest whole number.  APOBEC_to_G_MutLoad_MinEstimate is calculated only for samples with a "BH_Fisher_p-value_tCw_to_G" value less than or equal to 0.05, signifying a statistical over-representation of APOBEC_to_G mutagenesis.  Samples with "BH_Fisher_p-value_tCw_to_G" value greater than 0.05 receive a value of 0."
APOBEC_to_T_MutLoad_MinEstimate	"A minimum estimate of the number of APOBEC_to_T mutations induced by APOBEC cytidine deaminase in a sample.  This estimate is calculated using the formula: [""APOBEC_to_T""]*[(""tCw_to_T_enrich""-1)/""tCw_to_T_enrich""] to determine the number of APOBEC_to_T signature mutations in excess of what would be expected by random mutagenesis.

APOBEC_to_T_MutLoad_MinEstimate is calculated only for samples with a "BH_Fisher_p-value_tCw_to_T" value less than or equal to 0.05, signifying a statistical over-representation of APOBEC_to_T mutagenesis.  Samples with "BH_Fisher_p-value_tCw_to_T" value greater than 0.05 receive a value of 0."
p_value_Chi-squared_APOBEC_to_G_vs_APOBEC_to_T	p-value of two-sided Chi-squared goodness of fit calculated for the ratio "APOBEC_to_G_MutLoad_MinEstimate" to "APOBEC_to_T_MutLoad_MinEstimate" compared with the ratio expected if these values are equal
